> July 15, 2024 onwards, the government of Bangladesh launched a brutal campaign of quashing student protest demanding merit based jobs by indiscriminately firing at unarmed protesters for days. The security forces used shotgun and automatic weapon to shoot at protesters at point blank range.

> Bangladesh is now under curfew and there are boots on the ground. The Gestapo, DGFI and Detective Branch, has locked up over fifteen thousand demonstrators for alleged disorderly conduct and disrupting peace.
